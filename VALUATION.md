## 2. "Build vs Buy" Analysis (ROI)

Why build this instead of paying for a SaaS (Software as a Service)?

### Option A: The "SaaS Stack" (Competitors)
*Cost to rent similar capability using off-the-shelf tools.*

1.  **Booking Platform (e.g., Phorest/Timely/Fresha):** £300/mo (Base) + £50/staff
    *   *For a 10-staff salon:* £800/mo
2.  **Marketing Suite (Mailchimp/Klaviyo):** £150/mo
3.  **Website Builder (Squarespace/Wix):** £30/mo
4.  **Commission Fees (New Clients):** ~£800/mo (Treatwell/Fresha take 20% of first appointment)
5.  **Staff Rotation Tool (Deputy):** £40/mo

*   **Monthly Cost:** ~£1,800+
*   **Annual Cost:** **£21,600 per year (forever)**
*   **5-Year Cost:** **£108,000**

### Option B: "The Salon" (Owned IP)
*   **One-time Build Cost:** ~£35k - £50k (Valuation)
*   **Monthly Hosting:** £20 (Vercel/Netlify)
*   **Annual Operational Cost:** £240
*   **Breakeven Point:** ~2 Years

**Winner:** Building your own platform generates **£50k+ in purely financial savings** over 5 years.

## 3. Intangible Value (Why it's worth more)

1.  **Brand Equity:** A fully bespoke, high-end digital experience signals "Luxury" far better than a generic booking widget.
2.  **Date Ownership:** You own 100% of your client data. SaaS platforms often restrict export or charge for it.
3.  **Agility:** You can add features (like the "AI Skin Analysis") that competitors simply don't have.
4.  **Resale Value:** This software is an *asset* that increases the valuation of the physical salon business.
